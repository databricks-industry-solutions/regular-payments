# MAGIC # The Theory
# MAGIC Before delving into the actual solution, let's get back to our physics fundamentals. In this notebook, we will explore signal processing theory as it may apply to retail banking and card transaction data. Let's select an hypothetical user for a subscription service we know would exhibit strong seasonality (such as Netflix). Easy to eye ball on a graph, such a payment regularity would be difficult to programmatically extract from billions of card transactions, especially when the regularity of payments may not be of exact match (bank holidays or missed payments).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC As represented below, we can extract all frequencies composing our signal. As expected, a series of pulse functions will only be explained by the superposition of an infinite number of frequencies. We know our signal is highly regular, but the superposition of all harmonics makes it hard to extract a dominant frequency

# MAGIC Our assumption is confirmed by litterature, pulse signal in the time domain is only explained by an infinite number of harmonics. 
# MAGIC Using simple utility functions, we can easily convert our pulse signals into a triangular form, maximizing the effectiveness of a fourier transform whilst preserving our signal latent value at most.

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC As represented below, by transforming our signal into a triangular function, fourier transform yields more significant insights, peaking at a dominent frequency at around 10Hz. Thinking in term of Hertz does not offer much practicality. By converting frequencies to periods (in days), we observe our seasonality peak at ~ 30 days, as expected. Payments to Netflix are done every 30 days in average

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC We can extract dominant frequencies through kernel density, just like one would extract anomalies from a given set of data points. Whilst we could leverage anomaly detection techniques like Isolation Forests, it would be wrong to assume each signal exhibit regularity. By specifying a "contamination" parameter, we would be forcing our framework to return anomalies. Instead, we can find out how "packed" our data points are and define a kernel threshold to contains 99% of our possible distances

# COMMAND ----------

threshold = detect_anomalies(fft_ts_tri.amplitudes)

# MAGIC Finally, we have been able to programmatically extract dominant frequencies for our payments. Summarizing that particular payment as a series of sine waves will allow us to overlay multiple signals that could model someone's financial behaviors.
