*Using signal processing theory and Fourier transforms, we extract regular payment informations from a large dataset 
of card transactions data. Although it is easy to eye ball regularity in payments when looking at specific 
transactions, doing so at scale across billions of card transactions requires a scientific (and programmatic) 
approach to a business problem. In this solution accelerator, we demonstrate a novel approach to consumer analytics 
by combining core mathematical concepts with engineering best practices and state of the art optimizations techniques 
to better model customers' behaviors and provide millions of customers with personalized insights. With 40% of 
americans struggling to come up with $400 for an unexpected expense 
[[source](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/20/heres-why-so-many-americans-cant-handle-a-400-unexpected-expense.html)], 
such a framework could be used to suggest financial goals and provide customers with recommended actions to better 
spread regular payments over billing cycles, minimize periods of financial vulnerability and better plan for 
unexpected events.*
